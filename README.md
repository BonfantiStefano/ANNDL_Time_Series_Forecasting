# Artificial Neural Netweorks and Deep Learning Competition
In this repository there can be found the *Jupyter Notebooks* used by me and my collegues to participate to the competition of Politecnico di Milano course *Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning* (2023/2024).

## Time Series Forecasting
**Goal:** Design and implement forecasting models to learn how to exploit past observations in the input sequences to correctly predict the future.

**Evaluation**: The metric used to evaluate models is the Mean Squared Error.

**Final result**: In the end with our neural network model we achieved a MSE of 0.00983344 on the final test set, where it was asked to predict the following 18 samples given a window of 200 samples.
